- **Portal Crash: Card Game Assistant** is an digital card game assistant for the game called Portal Crash: Warriors of the sea. The Portal Crash: Card Game Assistant will help Portal Crash Game masters to calculate players and monster attacks ingame, making the card game easy to manipulate by the Game Master. This Web app aims to ease the way Portal Crash game masters calculate players and monster attack ingame instead of using traditional calculators which is making the game slower.
